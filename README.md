Getting Started
To get started with our LCD modules, you will need to have a basic understanding of electronics and microcontrollers. The datasheets provided in this repository contain information on how to interface with the modules, but we recommend that you have experience with programming microcontrollers and reading datasheets.

LCD Modules
Our LCD modules come in a variety of sizes and configurations, and each module has its own datasheet. In this repository, you will find the datasheets for all of our LCD modules, as well as example code for interfacing with each module.

The datasheets contain information on the pinouts, operating voltage, and communication protocol for each module. Additionally, the datasheets contain timing diagrams and example code for interfacing with the modules.

To find the datasheet for a specific module, navigate to the datasheets directory in this repository and look for the corresponding file.

Drivers
We have developed drivers for our LCD modules that make interfacing with the modules easier. The drivers are written in C and are designed to be used with microcontrollers.

In this repository, you will find the source code for each driver. The drivers are organized by module type, and each driver is contained in its own directory.

To use a driver, simply include the header file in your code and call the appropriate functions. The header files and function documentation can be found in the drivers directory.

Contributing
We welcome contributions to this repository! If you find a bug in one of our drivers or have developed a new driver for one of our modules, please feel free to submit a pull request.

When contributing, please follow our code of conduct and contribution guidelines.
